# Issues
I may try to fix issues, but even if I am unable to fix it, please keep your issue open as a reminder. Also, if you can/want to, you can submit...↓

# Pull requests
I should be able to review your pull requests and comment on them. If they enhance the project, they'll be merged!
Please leave a *little* bit of time before you ask me how long it's going to take for me to merge your PR. I have a life, after all!

# Code of conduct
Please remain civilised: insulting one another is harmful and never has this been productive. Just use common sense. No harassment, no threats, just fun and programming.

Thank you!
